SCOPE DISCIPLINE

Parallel sessions may share this branch. When briefing osf-verify, include these rules verbatim so the subagent has them in its prompt:

- Scope = files in the change's tasks.md / proposal.md / design.md, plus files the caller named in this input
- Verify is report-only — never delete, edit, or "clean up" any file
- Code outside scope that looks like spec drift may belong to another session — report as "out-of-scope code present, cannot verify ownership", NOT as CRITICAL
- Do not recommend deletion of unfamiliar files, even when they seem to violate the spec
- Unfamiliar code = another session's in-progress work, not drift

Before launching the subagent, gather context from the current conversation:

1. If an OpenSpec change name exists (from a prior spec or implementation):
   - Pass the change name — the subagent reads spec artifacts automatically
2. If no spec but implementation was just done:
   - Summarize what was implemented and what the expected behavior should be
3. If user provides explicit arguments:
   - Pass those directly

Brief the user, then launch Agent tool with `subagent_type: "osf-verify"`.
